# todo-list
This is a simple to-do list app built with JavaScript. You can add, edit, and delete tasks, mark them as completed, and filter tasks by All, Completed, or Pending. The app also saves tasks using local storage, so they stay even after refreshing the page. A progress bar shows how many tasks are completed.
